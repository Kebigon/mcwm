This is a small window manager for the X Window System written
entirely with XCB, the straight X protocol binding to the C language.
It doesn't use libX11 which most older window managers do.

It's a traditional 'floating' window manager. It doesn't really do
anything new to the user experience. It is pretty stupid, but can
probably be useful for some people.

== Usage ==

With the the default configuration, use it like this:

  Mod1 + mouse buttons:

    1 move
    2 raise
    3 resize

  Mod2 + key:

    r		raise or lower (toggles)
    x 		maximize
    m 		maximize vertically
    h 		move left
    j 		move down
    k 		move up
    l 		move right
    H 		resize left
    J 		resize down
    K 		resize up
    L 		resize right
    Return	start terminal

If you don't like the default key bindings, border width, et cetera,
look in the config.h file, change and recompile.
