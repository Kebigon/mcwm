This is a small window manager for the X Window System written
entirely with XCB, the straight X protocol binding to the C language.

It's a traditional 'floating' window manager. It doesn't really give
anything new to the user experience. It is pretty stupid, but can
probably be useful for some people.

If you don't like the default key bindings, border width, et cetera,
look in the config.h file, change and recompile.

See the manual page for how to use it.
