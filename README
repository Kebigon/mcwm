This is a small window manager for the X Window System written
entirely with XCB, the straight X protocol binding to the C language.
It doesn't use libX11 which most older window managers do.

It's a traditional 'floating' window manager. It doesn't really do
anything new to the user experience. It is pretty stupid, but can
probably be useful for some people.

== Start ==

Start like this:

  mcwm [-b] [-t /full/path/toterminal]

-b means draw no borders around windows.

-t /usr/local/bin/urxvt will start the urxvt terminal emulator when
Mod1 + Return is pressed.

Typically mcwm will start automatically when you start the X Window
System. If you start from the console, you need an .xinitrc file.
Here's a complete example:

----------------- 8< -----------------
#! /bin/sh

# Set nice background.
xsetroot -mod 16 16 -fg rgb:54/6/6 -bg grey20

# Set nice pointer cursor.
xsetroot -cursor_name plus -fg white -bg black

# Load resources.
xrdb -load ~/.Xresources

# Start window manager in the background. If it dies, X still lives.
mcwm &

# Start a terminal in the foreground. If this dies, X dies.
urxvt
----------------- 8< -----------------

If you are using a graphical login program such as XDM you can use the
same file as .xsession instead.

== Use ==

With the the default configuration, use mcwm like this:

  Mod1 + mouse buttons:

    1 move
    2 raise
    3 resize

  Mod2 + key:

    r		raise or lower (toggles)
    x 		maximize
    m 		maximize vertically
    h 		move left
    j 		move down
    k 		move up
    l 		move right
    H 		resize left
    J 		resize down
    K 		resize up
    L 		resize right
    Return	start terminal

If you don't like the default key bindings, border width, et cetera,
look in the config.h file, change and recompile.
