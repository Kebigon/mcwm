This is a small window manager for the X Window System written
entirely with XCB, the straight X protocol binding to the C language.
It doesn't use libX11, like most older window managers do.

It's a traditional 'floating' window manager. It doesn't really do
anything new to the user experience. It is pretty stupid, but can
probably be useful for some people.

Unlike most window managers, however, it is not a reparenting window
manager. This means it might be able to run simultaneously with
another window manager if you just want to get at the key bindings to
manipulate windows. If this will work or not depends pretty much on
what the other window manager thinks about stuff happening to windows
without it looking.

== Usage ==

With the the default configuration, use it like this:

  Mod1 key + mouse buttons:

    1 move
    2 raise
    3 resize

  Mod2 key + key:

    r		raise
    x 		maximize
    m 		maximize vertically
    h 		move left
    j 		move down
    k 		move up
    l 		move right
    H 		resize left
    J 		resize down
    K 		resize up
    L 		resize right
    Return	start terminal

If you don't like the default key bindings, border width, et cetera,
look in the config.h file, change and recompile.
