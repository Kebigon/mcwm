In order of importance:

* Run under some memory checker. DMALLOC?

* GTK apps has some extra windows that are initially unmapped. How do
  we handle these?

* Changing focus from keyboard

  Save the subwindows of the root window and focus each when pressing
  modkey + user_key_change. First option always last focused window.

* "R" should toggle stack order.

* "M" and "X" should toggle.

  Store original geom in X properties for the window.

* Move to corners: YU BN.

  Quickly move a window to the corners of the screen, a la evilwm.

* Use window resizing hints.

* Obey no-input hints.

  Don't focus on these windows at all. Does unclutter use this?

* Flag to disable dontmoveoff.

* Handle colours for real. Don't just assume raw pixel values will work.

* Special treatment when someone resizes a maximed window... Should it
  be possible at all? Set new border width.
  
  Set and read window hint about maximized state.

* Virtual workspaces

  Store workspace data in an X property for the window.

  When changing workspace, look for the windows with the right
  property.

  possibly store internally as well, so we don't generate so much
  traffic?

* RandR/Xinerama

  Get physical screen characteristics. Maximize and move to corners
  should consider the screen it's on.

* Key to move to another physical screen.

* Use event handlers?
