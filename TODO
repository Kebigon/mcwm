* Feedback window
  
  We need to tell the user the new geometry somehow. Is this what I
  want?

  The feedback window can also show what workspace we just changed to.

  Can we cooperate with a stand-alone program? Write our status to a
  root hint than can be picked up by another program?

* Changing focus from keyboard

  Save the subwindows of the root window and focus each when pressing
  modkey + user_key_change. First option always last focused window.

  Partly done. I have added a linked list of all windows and can walk
  around them in a simple window ring.

  We need to re-arrange the list so the last focused window gets to be
  the next in ring. Perhaps simply move the focused window to head of
  list after finishing focusing? How do we know when we're finished
  and have the focus we want? Both Tab and Mod2 are released. Use a
  mode?

  How do we re-establish stack order after moving around windows to
  focus on?

* Virtual screens/workspaces

  Partially done. Still needed:

  - A window might be on one, *several* or all virtual screens. 

    We already have a way of fixing a window on all screens (Mod2-f),
    but we need a way of saying "stick on this workspace". Perhaps
    something like Mod2-a <n>, where <n> is 1--9 for virtual screens.
    Better ways? Note that this seems to be mildly incompatible with
    the EWMH _NET_WM_DESKTOP hint we're currently using: We will only
    be able to save one of the desktops used.

* Hide windows

  Instead of iconifying, hide them Ã  la 9wm. Even if we use a key to
  hide them, this probably means we have to have a menu to get them
  back.

* Menu

  We might need a menu for hidden windows (see above). Since I'm z
  probably implementing menu windows anyway, perhaps I should add a
  menu with basic window functions, like 9wm and twm. This way, one
  might use the window manager without keyboard, if necessary. Not
  much work if I have to do the menu anyway...

* Snap to border and screen edge, which favours the edge.

* Gaps on borders for docks, status windows et cetera.

  Keep space reserverd for Conky, dzen2 et cetera.
  
  Also handle EWMH hints _NET_WM_TYPE_DOCK and _NET_WM_TYPE_DESKTOP.

* Flag to disable dontmoveoff?

* RandR/Xinerama

  Get physical screen characteristics for every screen. Maximize, move
  to corners should respect the screen it's on. We want a set of
  workspaces for every physical screen as well.

  xcb_randr_screen_size_t

  xcb_randr_screen_size_iterator_t

  xcb_randr_get_screen_info_reply_t

  xcb_randr_set_screen_size_request_t

  How do we handle window moves from one screen to another. Should we
  snap to the physical screen's edge and then allow move to continue?

* Key to move pointer to another physical screen.

* Use xcb-event's event handlers?

* Configurable keys.

* Configuration file.

* Start configurable programs when clicking on root window.

* Handle Urgency hint

  Some windows might need attention and marks this with an urgency
  hint (for instance, urxvt can generate such a hint when receiving
  the BEL character). Do we want to handle it? How do we tell the
  user? Can this be done with some stand-alone program instead?

* Support sensible portions of ICCCM and EWMH

  At least user set position and geometry.

  EWMH hints that tells applications about active workspace and
  focused window...

  And a few others.
