  * When moving by keyboard, we don't warp the pointer along with the
    window if the pointer was outside the window to begin with.

  * Don't allow moving or resizing of fully maximized windows.

2010-07-21

  * Will react on signals directly instead of waiting for next X event.

  * Raises windows before moving to corner.

2010-07-20

  * Grabbed keypresses that mcwm doesn't know what to do with will be
    sent to the focused window.

  * More bug fixes.

2010-07-19-2

  * Many bug fixes. Including crashing bugs, triggered under Linux.

2010-07-18

  * Move and resize, both with keyboard and mouse, now keeps pointer
    in place within window if it's possible without losing focus.

  * Move window to screen corners with YUBN.

2010-07-10

  * Border colour of fixed windows can be set from command line with
    -x colour.

  * Dies gracefully and maps all windows on all workspaces.

  * Handle unmapped, but inactive, windows when changing workspaces.
    This means that xpdf's and gv's transient windows won't show up
    again when changing workspaces unless they're currently really
    active.

2010-07-07

  * Rearranges windows to be visible and fit on screen if a physical
    screen is removed or screen is tilted.

  * Maximize and vertical maximize toggles.

  * First virtual workspace, that is 1, is now numbered as 0 in the
    _NET_WM_DESKTOP as in the rest of the window managers following
    EWMH.

2010-06-30

  * Virtual workspaces available with Mod2-0,1,2... Fix on all
    workspaces with Mod2-f.

2010-06-29

  * Focus can change from keyboard with Mod2-Tab.

2010-06-24-3

  * -f and -u options for focused and unfocused colours.

2010-06-24

  * When starting, we don't care about windows with override redirect
    set. This means, for instance, that if a GTK application was
    running when we started, we won't draw any borders around its
    menus.

  * New option, -t <terminal-program>.

  * Fixed bugs.

2010-06-22

  * Handles size changes of the root window. That is, if the user adds
    an additional screen or removes one when the X server supports
    RANDR.

  * MODKEY + R toggles raise/lower of window.

  * Maps new windows on pointer position and tries to fit on screen.

  * Resizes with size hints. This means, for instance, that most
    programs using fixed width fonts resizes by font width and height.
    No feedback yet, though.

  * Handles more requests, which means usable with more programs
    (xterm and xpdf, for instance, which hardly worked before).

  * Fixed bugs.

  * Now a real window manager. Now controls mapping of windows. If we
    can't be a real window manager, this probably means there is
    already one running, so we fall back to co-running.

    Windows are mapped at the pointer position if we can control it.

  * A flag, -b, for not drawing any borders what so ever. Might be
    useful when co-running.

  * Now doesn't raise windows all the time while moving or resizing
    with the mouse. Just raises once.
