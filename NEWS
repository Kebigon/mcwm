   * If you change focus window mcwm remembers where we last had
     focus. If you start using MODKEY+Tab to move around the window
     list the first Tab will always bring you to where we last had
     focus.

   * Resets per window state of max or vertical max when physical
     screen size changes.

   * Doesn't reset x coordinate when unmaxing vertically.

   * Specifically grab the keycodes we use and keycodes + shift
     modifier. Now works OK with xbindkeys.

   NOTA BENE! Modifier key changed! Now using Mod4 instead of Mod2 for
   key bindnings. I've been using my own key maps for so long that I
   forgot all about NumLock usually being Mod2 and users complained.
   I'm sorry.

  * Fixed bug. We mangled a list when a window was destroyed on
    another workspace. This would lead to sticky windows that we
    didn't seem to know about. 

    The same code also prepares for the possibility that a window
    might occupy several, but not all, workspaces at the same time. We
    still don't have any user interface to control this, however.

  * New key: MODKEY + End closes window. Patch from Christian
    Neukirchen, who used MODKEY + ESC instead.

2010-08-23

  * Obey window coordinates when doing initial mapping if the client
    says the user specified them, for instance with a -geometry.

2010-08-10

  * Mod2-Tab no longer raises a window unless it's necessary for the
    window to be visible.

  * We no longer obey clients trying to map themselves on the current
    workspace when they belong to another workspace. Notably, this
    affects Emacs frames used with emacsclient if server-raise-frame
    is non-nil. The mouse pointer will still be warped, though, but at
    least we stop the window on the other workspace to suddenly move
    to the current workspace.

  * Now works with unclutter.

2010-07-23

  * Better use of size increments.

2010-07-22

  * When resizing by keyboard we don't warp the pointer along with the
    window if the pointer was outside the window when we started
    resizing.

2010-07-21-2

  * When moving by keyboard, we don't warp the pointer along with the
    window if the pointer was outside the window to begin with.

  * Don't allow moving or resizing of fully maximized windows.

2010-07-21

  * Will react on signals directly instead of waiting for next X event.

  * Raises windows before moving to corner.

2010-07-20

  * Grabbed keypresses that mcwm doesn't know what to do with will be
    sent to the focused window.

  * More bug fixes.

2010-07-19-2

  * Many bug fixes. Including crashing bugs, triggered under Linux.

2010-07-18

  * Move and resize, both with keyboard and mouse, now keeps pointer
    in place within window if it's possible without losing focus.

  * Move window to screen corners with YUBN.

2010-07-10

  * Border colour of fixed windows can be set from command line with
    -x colour.

  * Dies gracefully and maps all windows on all workspaces.

  * Handle unmapped, but inactive, windows when changing workspaces.
    This means that xpdf's and gv's transient windows won't show up
    again when changing workspaces unless they're currently really
    active.

2010-07-07

  * Rearranges windows to be visible and fit on screen if a physical
    screen is removed or screen is tilted.

  * Maximize and vertical maximize toggles.

  * First virtual workspace, that is 1, is now numbered as 0 in the
    _NET_WM_DESKTOP as in the rest of the window managers following
    EWMH.

2010-06-30

  * Virtual workspaces available with Mod2-0,1,2... Fix on all
    workspaces with Mod2-f.

2010-06-29

  * Focus can change from keyboard with Mod2-Tab.

2010-06-24-3

  * -f and -u options for focused and unfocused colours.

2010-06-24

  * When starting, we don't care about windows with override redirect
    set. This means, for instance, that if a GTK application was
    running when we started, we won't draw any borders around its
    menus.

  * New option, -t <terminal-program>.

  * Fixed bugs.

2010-06-22

  * Handles size changes of the root window. That is, if the user adds
    an additional screen or removes one when the X server supports
    RANDR.

  * MODKEY + R toggles raise/lower of window.

  * Maps new windows on pointer position and tries to fit on screen.

  * Resizes with size hints. This means, for instance, that most
    programs using fixed width fonts resizes by font width and height.
    No feedback yet, though.

  * Handles more requests, which means usable with more programs
    (xterm and xpdf, for instance, which hardly worked before).

  * Fixed bugs.
  
2010-06-19

  * Now a real window manager. Now controls mapping of windows. If we
    can't be a real window manager, this probably means there is
    already one running, so we fall back to co-running.

    Windows are mapped at the pointer position if we can control it.

  * A flag, -b, for not drawing any borders what so ever. Might be
    useful when co-running.

  * Now doesn't raise windows all the time while moving or resizing
    with the mouse. Just raises once.
