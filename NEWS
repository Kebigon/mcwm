  * Now a real window manager. Now controls mapping of windows. If we
    can't be a real window manager, this probably means there is
    already one running, so we fall back to co-running.

    Windows are mapped at the pointer position if we can control it.

  * A flag, -b, for not drawing any borders what so ever. Might be
    useful when co-running.

  * Now doesn't raise windows all the time while moving or resizing
    with the mouse. Just raises once.
