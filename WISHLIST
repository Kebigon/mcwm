A wishlist for a window manager:

- Small.

- Few external dependencies, both for running and building.

- Fast.

- Minimal decoration.

- Sloppy focus.

- Changing focus from keyboard which rememebers last focused window.
  Keep on the same physical screen.

- Focus change from keyboard should restore stacking order after focus
  switch.

- Key bindings for all window functions.

- Configurable key bindings.

- Vertical and maximum maximizing.

- Don't move off physical screen. Configurable?

- Know about physical screens dynamically (RandR).

- Virtual screens. Separate sets for each physical screen.

  A window should be able to occupy one, several or all virtual
  screens.

- Remember where pointer was on virtual screen. Or at least remember
  what window had focus.

- Quickly move windows to corners.

- Window placement on virtual screens should be remembered even if wm
  killed and restarted.
